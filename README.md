# DSIDE - Municipal Money

The project was aimed towards aiding municipalities of South Africa to better measure their performance 
in terms of Service Delivery and Efficiency. We achieved this through the creation 
of a *profiling measure*. Furthermore we investigated which youth characteristics are
associated with *youth unemployment*. An extensive tool was developed in the form of a dashboard, 
where the results and real time predictions of the developed models can be viewed.


- We several machine learning techiques:

* Principal Componet Analysis (PCA): to find the features which affect youth employment.
* Decision Tree and Random Forests : to predictions the probability of youth getting employed given the characteristics of their municipalmoney
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)    : to predict the profile of the municipality
