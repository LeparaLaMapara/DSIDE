# DSIDE - Municipal Money

The projeect was aimed towards aiding municipalities of South Africa to better measure their performance 
in terms of Service Delivery and Efficiency. We achieved this through the creation 
of a profiling measure. Furthermore we investigated which youth characteristics are
 associated with youth unemployment. An extensive tool was developed in the form of a dashboard, 
where the results and real time predictions of the developed models can be viewed.
